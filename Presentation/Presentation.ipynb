    "In just a few months, COVID-19 became a pandemic that set the world on its heels. Nations scrambled to coordinate an effective response as COVID-19 spread indiscriminately. Donald Trump, whose presidency of the United States has been characterized with inaccurate statements and incohesive positions on a variety of pertinent issues such as healthcare, worker protections, and social safety nets, has tweeted extensively about the progression of theCOVID-19 pandemic, sometimes contradicting his own tweets later in the day.\n",
