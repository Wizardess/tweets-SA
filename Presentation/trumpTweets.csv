1,2020-04-11 23:34:58+00:00,"So now the Fake News @nytimes is tracing the CoronaVirus origins back to Europe, NOT China. This is a first! I wonder what the Failing New York Times got for this one? Are there any NAMED sources? They were recently thrown out of China like dogs, and obviously want back in. Sad!"
2,2020-04-11 23:28:18+00:00,"Governor @GavinNewsom of California has been very nice &amp; highly supportive about the great job we have done, working together, for California. That is the good news, but this is the bad. He is unfairly under attack by the Radical Left Dems, MSDNC etc. He is strong! Will he fold?"
3,2020-04-11 22:38:29+00:00,I will be watching. HAVE A GREAT EASTER!
4,2020-04-11 22:35:35+00:00,"The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board doesn’t have a clue on how to fight and win. Their views on Tariffs & Trade are losers for the U.S., but winners for other countries, including China. If we followed their standards, we’d have no Country left. They should love Sleepy Joe!"
5,2020-04-11 21:53:36+00:00,"Watching @FoxNews on weekend afternoons is a total waste of time. We now have some great alternatives, like @OANN."
6,2020-04-11 21:48:58+00:00,"“The President and the Federal Government are doing an excellent job. When they say the death toll isn’t going to be as high as reported, they (the opposition) act like they’re sad because it’s lower. I think they are (Press Conferences) wonderful.” West Virginia Resident, C Span"

10,2020-04-11 18:47:39+00:00,....Does anyone ever notice how few quotes from an actual person are given nowadays by the Lamestream Media. Very seldom. The unnamed or anonymous sources are almost always FAKE NEWS.
11,2020-04-11 18:43:03+00:00,"When the Failing @nytimes or Amazon @washingtonpost writes a story saying “unnamed sources said”, or any such phrase where a person’s name is not used, don’t believe them. Most of these unnamed sources don’t exist. They are made up to defame &amp; disparage. They have no “source”..."

16,2020-04-10 15:42:10+00:00,"Nobody wants to say that if Elizabeth Warren gets out of the race before Super Tuesday, Crazy Bernie Sanders wins virtually every state in a blowout...NOT EVEN CLOSE!

18,2020-04-10 14:36:41+00:00,"Because the T.V. Ratings for the White House News Conference’s are the highest, the Opposition Party (Lamestream Media), the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats &, of course, the few remaining RINO’S, are doing everything in their power to disparage & end them. The People’s Voice!"

24,2020-04-10 11:32:26+00:00,"Democrats are blocking a 251 Billion Dollar funding boost for Small Businesses which will help them keep their employees. It should be for only that reason, with no additions. We should have a big Infrastructure Phase Four with Payroll Tax Cuts & more. Big Economic Bounceback!"
25,2020-04-10 11:30:20+00:00,"This week, in only 4 days, we had the biggest Stock Market increase since 1974. We have a great chance for the really big bounce when the Invisible Enemy is gone!"

WSJ is Fake News!"

34,2020-04-09 15:08:05+00:00,.@OANN A key CoronaVirus Model is now predicting far fewer deaths than the number shown in earlier models. That’s because the American people are doing a great job. Social Distancing etc. Keep going!

Trump Derangement Syndrome!"
47,2020-04-08 14:42:24+00:00,"The Radical Left Democrats have gone absolutely crazy that I am doing daily Presidential News Conferences. They actually want me to STOP! They used to complain that I am not doing enough of them, now they complain that I “shouldn’t be allowed to do them.” They tried to shame....."

49,2020-04-08 12:20:48+00:00,"Republicans should fight very hard when it comes to state wide mail-in voting. Democrats are clamoring for it. Tremendous potential for voter fraud, and for whatever reason, doesn’t work out well for Republicans. @foxandfriends"

58,2020-04-07 15:22:46+00:00,"Why didn’t the I.G., who spent 8 years with the Obama Administration (Did she Report on the failed H1N1 Swine Flu debacle where 17,000 people died?), want to talk to the Admirals, Generals, V.P. & others in charge, before doing her report. Another Fake Dossier!"
59,2020-04-07 15:04:16+00:00,"The W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look. Fortunately I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation?"

Gee, I wonder why? Also, what ever happened to that phone call he told the Fake News he wanted to make to me?"
70,2020-04-06 13:08:58+00:00,"Advertising in the Failing New York Times is WAY down. Washington Post is not much better. I can’t say whether this is because they are Fake News sources of information, to a level that few can understand, or the Virus is just plain beating them up. Fake News is bad for America!"

477,2020-03-04 11:52:25+00:00,"The Democrat establishment came together and crushed Bernie Sanders, AGAIN!
